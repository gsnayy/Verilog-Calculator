# Verilog-Calculator
Hello!
Due to a difficulty in accessing the .v files, I have uploaded the code to a .docx file specifying which are source and simulation codes.
Included is a report going along with this project.
This project implements Verilog on the FPGA board. It uses the push buttons to output numbers 1-5 on the seven segment display whith the option of adding, subtracting, 
or multiplying the two numbers and displaying the result in hexadecimal.
